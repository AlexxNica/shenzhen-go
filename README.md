# "SHENZHEN GO" (working title)

SHENZHEN GO (working title) is an **experimental** visual Go environment, inspired by programming puzzle games such as TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O.

It structures a Go program as a visual graph where the nodes are goroutines and the arrows are channels. 

## Dependencies

SHENZHEN GO requires:

*   A recent Go installation.
*   Graphviz installed.
*   A web browser.

## Installation

After setting up your `$GOPATH`, run:

    go get -u TODO-PACKAGE-PATH-HERE

This should build the `shenzhen-go` binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.
Run it and a web browser should appear with the SHENZHEN GO editor.


## Notes

This is not an official Google product.

This is an experimental project - expect plenty of rough edges and bugs, and no support.
